Hi, my name is Tomasz, I'm a software developer and CS student from Poland.
My main interest is C++ but I like to experiment so you can expect some posts about Python or Clojure as well!

In general, I'm going to post about the things that I'm learning while working on my projects and my design decisions.

My current endeavour is coding a rhythm game in C++ so most posts are going to be about that journey.
